This solution contains:
- Yaffut (Yet another framework for unit testing). One File: yaffut.h
- DllTest: Example WindowsDll Project, containing some simple tests
- YaDllRunner: Console Application, which loads Dlls and executes Yaffut tests inside


Enabled SEH exceptions: so that e.g. acces violations in tested code, can be trapped

Usage: YaDllRunner.exe MyTests.dll -> Loads a dll, containing yaffut tests and executes them
